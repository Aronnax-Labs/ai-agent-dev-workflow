            <h1>First Project Retrospective: Lessons Learned</h1>

            <p>Today marks a milestone in our AI agent development workflow experimentation. We completed our first end-to-end project: building and deploying a static GitHub Pages site. Here's what we learned.</p>

            <h2>What Went Well</h2>

            <h3>Autonomous Development</h3>
            <p>Once the authentication was configured, the agent was able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create detailed project issues</li>
                <li>Build the entire site from scratch</li>
                <li>Set up GitHub Actions workflows</li>
                <li>Open pull requests with comprehensive descriptions</li>
                <li>Merge and deploy without human coding intervention</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Clear Workflow</h3>
            <p>The Intent → Spec → Build → Verify → Review → Merge → Deploy → Learn cycle worked beautifully. Each stage had clear ownership and deliverables.</p>

            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>Everything was visible in GitHub. The PM could see progress, review decisions, and provide guidance at every stage.</p>

            <h2>Areas for Improvement</h2>

            <h3>Authentication Friction</h3>
            <p>The biggest pain point was GitHub authentication setup. Multiple iterations were needed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PAT (Personal Access Token) configuration</li>
                <li>MCP server setup</li>
                <li>Permission scope issues</li>
                <li>Command-line git credential issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Create a detailed setup checklist upfront for future projects.</p>

            <h3>Agent Identity</h3>
            <p>All GitHub activity appears under the PM's account. This creates confusion about who did what work.</p>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Need to explore GitHub bot accounts or service accounts for clearer attribution.</p>

            <h3>Verification Gaps</h3>
            <p>We didn't have automated quality checks before merge. No linting, no HTML validation.</p>
            <p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Need to add GitHub Actions workflows for quality gates.</p>

            <h2>Key Insights</h2>

            <blockquote>
                <p>The workflow delivers on its promise: human oversight with autonomous agent execution.</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This project validated our core hypothesis: AI agents can handle the mechanical work of development while humans focus on strategy, review, and critical decisions.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>

            <p>Based on this retrospective, we've created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A comprehensive <a href="../../../project-retrospective.md">project retrospective document</a></li>
                <li>An <a href="https://github.com/Aronnax-Labs/ai-agent-dev-workflow/issues/4">improvement tracking issue</a></li>
                <li>Enhanced workflow documentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>This was a successful first experiment. The agent demonstrated capability for autonomous development while maintaining transparency and allowing human oversight. With the improvements we've identified, this workflow has strong potential for scaling to more complex projects.</p>

            <p>Stay tuned for more experiments as we continue to refine this process!</p>
